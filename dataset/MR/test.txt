1	cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless .

1	a very charming and funny movie . 
1	one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
1	the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
1	all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
1	like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
1	a different kind of love story - one that is dark , disturbing , painful to watch , yet compelling . 
1	invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
1	look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .

1	a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
1	it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .

1	occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . 
1	highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
1	just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
1	it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match .

1	ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane .

1	any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
1	all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable . 
1	the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
1	upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
1	a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill .

1	the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
1	the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
1	robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
1	the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
1	the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action .

0	first-time director joï¿½o pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
0	the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
0	in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
0	it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
0	this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .

0	ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '

0	as if drop dead gorgeous wasn't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition . 
0	a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
0	horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists . 
0	thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
0	the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
0	aan opportunity wasted . 
0	it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
0	no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
0	it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
0	a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
0	irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
0	a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
0	although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
0	an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
0	the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
0	the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
0	sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
0	most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
0	you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
0	not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
0	slap me , i saw this movie . 
0	it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
0	 . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
0	 . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
0	the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
0	harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
0	the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
0	it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
0	the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
0	schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
0	it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
0	it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
0	the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
0	the plot's contrivances are uncomfortably strained . 
0	opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist's death bed and doesn't get much livelier in the three hours in between . 
0	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
0	less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
0	i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
0	handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
0	the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
0	with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
0	a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
0	with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
0	with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
0	the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
0	most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
0	meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
0	kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
0	like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause . 
0	it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
0	sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
0	theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
0	too much power , not enough puff . 
0	despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
0	 . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
0	it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
0	the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
0	credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
0	a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
0	not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
0	at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
0	deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . 
0	far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
0	resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
0	has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
0	it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
0	you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
0	there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
0	so clichï¿½d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
0	the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
0	has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
0	despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
0	a pale xerox of other , better crime movies . 
0	comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . 
0	contrived pastiche of caper clichï¿½s . 
0	exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
0	like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
0	this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
0	a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
0	makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
0	shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
0	may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
0	i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
0	it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
0	the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
0	so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
0	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
0	neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
0	feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
0	meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
0	though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
0	after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichï¿½s , depression and bad alternative music . 
0	there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
0	for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
0	hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
0	everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
0	eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
0	though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
0	the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
0	would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
0	automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
0	this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
0	naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
0	i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
0	snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
0	it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
0	not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
0	a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
0	soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
0	weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
0	the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
0	an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort . 
0	a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
0	a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
0	instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
0	the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
0	some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
0	[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
0	i was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither . 
0	the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
0	if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
0	pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
0	a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
0	unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
0	it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
0	don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
0	i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i
0	long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
0	it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
0	barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
0	bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
0	in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
0	i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
0	comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
0	 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
0	the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
0	[allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
0	 . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
0	the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
0	starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
0	simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
0	a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
0	much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
0	being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
0	an extremely unpleasant film . 
0	tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
0	serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
0	the plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution . 
0	there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
0	i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
0	a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
0	humor in i spy is so anemic . 
0	any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
0	as pedestrian as they come . 
0	like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
0	the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
0	the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
0	whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
0	burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
0	nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
0	feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
0	the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
0	most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
0	the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
0	the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
0	circuit queens won't learn a thing , they'll be too busy cursing the film's strategically placed white sheets . 
0	it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
0	ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
0	forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
0	rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
0	the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
0	most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
0	a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
0	julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
0	with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
0	the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
0	a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
0	couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
0	evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
0	a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
0	by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
0	nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
0	no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
0	 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
0	this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
0	resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
0	the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
0	nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
0	so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
0	it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
0	imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
0	if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
0	none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
0	if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead .

0	there's nothing exactly wrong here , but there's not nearly enough that's right . 
0	a listless and desultory affair . 
0	too simple for its own good . 
0	a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
0	because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
0	the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
0	just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
0	the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
0	the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichï¿½s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
0	we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
0	so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
0	it's splash without the jokes . 
0	loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
0	a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
0	britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
0	the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
0	culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
0	the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
0	mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
0	the whole thing's fairly lame , making it par for the course for disney sequels . 
0	stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
0	always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
0	feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .

0	an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
0	staggeringly dreadful romance . 
0	k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
0	clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
0	formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
0	imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
0	too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
0	the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .

0	this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
0	carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
0	one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
0	if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
0	turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
0	sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
0	ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
0	hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
0	shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
0	may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
0	expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
0	friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
0	this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
0	has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
0	a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
0	i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problemï¿½it's supposed to be a drama . 
0	 . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
0	davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
0	i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
0	never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
0	[johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
0	this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
0	talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
0	lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
0	true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
0	i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
0	 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
0	the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
0	with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
0	all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
0	whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
0	[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
0	too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
